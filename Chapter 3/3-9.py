# 3-9. Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4 through 3-7 (page 46), use len() to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

guest_list = ['Jessica','Peter', 'John', 'Luke', 'Sarah', 'James', 'Jonathan']

print("I am inviting " + str(len(guest_list)) + " guests for my dinner party.")
