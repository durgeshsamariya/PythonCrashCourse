# 3-4. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

guest_list = ['Durgesh', 'John', 'Sarah', 'James']

print(guest_list[0] + " invited for dinne.")
print(guest_list[1] + " invited for dinne.")
print(guest_list[2] + " invited for dinne.")
print(guest_list[3] + " invited for dinne.")
