# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ['durgesh', 'james', 'robert', 'john']

print("Hello " + names[0].title() + ", How are you today?")
print("Hello " + names[1].title() + ", How are you today?")
print("Hello " + names[2].title() + ", How are you today?")
print("Hello " + names[3].title() + ", How are you today?")
