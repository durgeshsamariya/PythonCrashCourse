# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

cars = ['Audi', 'BMW', 'Toyota']

print("I own " + cars[0] + " Q7. I am planning to buy " + cars[1] + ". My first car was " + cars[2] + ".")
